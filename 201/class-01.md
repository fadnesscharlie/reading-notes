## HTML, Tags, and the Basics

### The Beginnings of a Website

In a website, what makes it a website is HTML. The first thing to any good website is well, what is the general idea of the website? What would you like it do? After that, we move on to our wireframe. A wireframe is an outline. On pen and paper you start to draw out how you want things to look. Examples of this would be, where would you like to place the navigation, logo, main topics and pictures.

### Our Content

In our website, we have our content, we now start to make our website. But wait, we dont add our content just yet, we start by making our boxes. The main box would be the `<body></body>`, inside out body tag is everything want the users to see. We start with our `<header></header>`, in our header we include things like our logo, naviagation bar, and everything you want on top of the page. Next we include things like `<main></main>`, where we add our content, from our images, descriptions, products, and everything else. There are many more tags you can use as well, depending on what you want to do.

### Tags

Above you would notice we are using certain brackets `<` and `>`. This are what the HTML reads as the start and end of a tag. We addour closing tag `</>` in some, not all of our tags as an indication of the end of the tag. Some tags dont use a closing tag, examaple of this would be an image tag `<img>`. It's called a self closing tag.

### Starting Out

Where do I even start out with all these "tags". A shortcut in case you dont know where to start, is with VSCode specifically, You can start a file with a `.html` at the end to declare an HTML document, and then type `!` along with Enter. This will create the base things you need for an HTML document to run. You will notice that the first thing you would see is `<!DOCTYPE html>`. This tells the browser that we are running HTML5 and to be read in that manner. Below you will notice there wont be anything displayed if you run the page, but you will get an idea of how things look, and you can easily jump into your coding without having to remember or write down all of the starting code for your website and how things should look.

### Languages of a Website

Now I'm sure you have heard of the three main languages that make a website a website. Those include HTML, CSS, and JavaScript(JS). In CSS, this is where we design the page, we add color, change the shape and size of things, and so much more. Think of it as an a painting(HTML) you outlined with pen, and now you want to add the colors, textures, and bring life to the page(CSS). In CSS we add them to our page in 3 different ways. Inline with the specific tag you want, add it to a section/head of the page, or linking a `.css` page. Linking a page is the best way to bring CSS to a page. We can make a page, then call upon that specific page to all of our HTML pages. Think if you had as many pages in your website as a wiki does, I don't think you want to add CSS to every single page which can be hundred of lines long. That is way to much work. Well, then why even do the other methods you ask? The other methods are very useful when targeting a specific tag, or overwriting. Which ever CSS is read last will get implemented. As we link our CSS to the top of our page so it can applied to everything when the page loads, if we add something in a tag, it will be read after the linked CSS page which will use the CSS in the tag.

## Programming

In programming, this is where we add JS. Basically the functionality of our website. We have our layout and fancy colors. Now we add JS to make the page do things. Example of this would be a pull down bar when you hover over the navigation line, it brings down a list of links or web pages to go to or adds things to your cart and totals the amount of the cost. These are example of JS. We add them to our page through a script on the HTML page, or link a `.js` page and call functions to activate either instantly or when called upon. We use the `<script></script>` tag to bring a function or lines of code into out HTML page. We mostly want to add any linked pages to the bottom, as we want our page to load first, then apply the JS after so it does not hinder the page loading. You dont want to see a white page, then everything laods. You want to see everything load all at once, and as you find what you want to do, the JS will then apply all of its things after.

This is the basics of a Website. There are many ways to create a website, depending on who you want to target, and what audience you want to come into your website. Look forward for more information as I move more into coding and learning new things that I can then teach you by reading my Markdown files. Until then!
